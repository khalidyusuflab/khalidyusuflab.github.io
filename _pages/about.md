Hi, I'm Khalid, an aspiring researcher interested in how our brains, bodies, and lifestyles interact as we age. 

I'm currently a Research Coordinator in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati, where I help lead studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to explore how dietary interventions such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation influence brain chemistry, oxidative stress, and cognitive function in psychiatric populations.

Research Interests
======
Broadly, my research interests focus on understanding the biological and psychosocial mechanisms that shape brain and cognitive aging, particularly in midlife and in older adulthood, and how these processes contribute to risk for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. 

I aim to integrate perspectives from clinical psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience. I’m also deeply committed to promoting brain health equity by identifying ways to support cognitive wellness in underserved and minority communities.
